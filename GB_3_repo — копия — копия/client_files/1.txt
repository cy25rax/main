1. Introduction
The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, more than two months after the first reported case in Wuhan, China on December 31st, 2019. Since this pandemic is economically different due to the number of cases reported in several developed countries and China, these countries have been hit hard by the corresponding negative effects (e.g., see Baldwin and di Mauro (2020)). These negative effects have quickly spilled over to other countries not only due to the contagious nature of COVID-19 medically but also due to the supply chain disruptions economically, because about 55% of world supply and demand is accounted for by China, Korea, Italy, Japan, the U.S. and Germany that have the most reported cases of COVID-19 according to Baldwin and Tomiura (2020).

As discussed in studies such as by Ivanov et al. (2017) or Ivanov (2020), supply chain disruptions can occur due to natural disasters (e.g., the earthquake and the tsunami in Japan in 2011), man-made catastrophes (e.g., an explosion at BASF factory in Germany in 2016) or employee strikes. These low-frequency-high-impact events can result in immediate disruptions in supply chains, because supplies, producers, transporters and distributors can be all affected due to one broken link. Accordingly, as discussed in studies such as by Ivanov et al. (2014), Garvey et al. (2015), Dolgui et al. (2018), Pavlov et al. (2019), Dolgui et al. (2020) or Li and Zobel (2020), material shortages and delivery delays are experienced in sectors involved in the supply chain, resulting in the ripple effect and thus productivity reductions.

Unlike supply chain disruptions (discussed so far) that are localized, pandemics such as COVID-19 can affect multiple supply chains simultaneously and cover multiple regions globally. Hence, these effects last longer, they can be more unpredictable, and they can result in simultaneous disruptions in supply, demand, and logistics infrastructure. For example, according to Ivanov (2020), 94% of the Fortune 1000 companies have experienced supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19. Similarly, Araz et al. (2020) underline that COVID-19 has broken many global supply chains simultaneously. Although these effects are not unique to COVID-19, and they were also observed in earlier epidemic outbreaks (e.g., see Johanis (2007), Chou et al. (2004), Calnan et al. (2018) or Büyüktahtakın et al. (2018)), its scale and geographical coverage have made COVID-19 a global phenomenon.

Based on this background, this paper investigates the effects of COVID-19 on the global economy. This is achieved by considering the corresponding effects on crude oil prices (COP) and the Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI). Specifically, COP can capture demand changes (among others) in the global economic activity as suggested in studies such as by Kilian (2009), whereas BDI is daily published by the Baltic Exchange in London, and it reflects the shipping costs (due to using vessels of various sizes covering multiple maritime routes) regarding the transportation of raw commodities (e.g., grain, coal, iron ore, copper). Since these shipping costs are determined by the supply and demand forces in the global market, they are robust to any speculative manipulation or any government intervention by construction (e.g., see Bildirici et al. (2015) or Graham et al. (2016)). Accordingly, several early or recent studies in the literature such as by Isserlis (1938), Tinbergen (1959), Stopford (2008), Klovland (2002), Kilian (2009), Fan and Xu (2011), Qiu et al. (2012) and Makridakis et al. (2020) have suggested using BDI (or similar indices) to identify global changes in the transportation of commodities.

The formal investigation is achieved by using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model, where the endogenous variables are selected as weekly percentage changes in daily COP and daily BDI. Since COVID-19 is an exogenous shock (i.e., it is not determined by either COP or BDI), percentage changes in daily COVID-19 cases in China and the rest of the world (ROW) are included as exogenous variables in this framework. Using daily data covering the period between January 28th, 2020 and November 15th, 2021, cumulative impulse responses of COP and BDI are estimated to identify the effects of COVID-19 on the global economy.

The corresponding results suggest that 1% of a weekly increase in daily COVID-19 cases in China results in about 0.02% of a cumulative increase in BDI after one week and about 0.03% of a cumulative increase after three months. Similarly, 1% of a weekly increase in daily COVID-19 cases in ROW results in about 0.05% of a cumulative increase in BDI after one week, although the effects become insignificant in longer horizons. These results are consistent with increases in COVID-19 cases acting as negative supply shocks in the transportation of commodities, similar to earlier studies such as by Ivanov et al. (2014), Garvey et al. (2015), Dolgui et al. (2018), Pavlov et al. (2019), Dolgui et al. (2020) or Li and Zobel (2020) who have shown that material shortages and delivery delays due to supply chain disruptions can easily result in the ripple effect and thus productivity reductions.

The results also suggest that 1% of a weekly increase in daily COVID-19 cases in China results in about 0.02% of a cumulative reduction in COP, whereas 1% of a weekly increase in daily COVID-19 cases in ROW results in about 0.13% of a cumulative reduction in COP after one week and 0.15% after one month. These results are consistent with a lower global demand (reflected as reductions in COP) following increases in COVID-19 cases. The historical decomposition results suggest that the effects of COVID-19 cases on BDI and COP have mostly been observed in the early COVID-19 period.

The relationship between BDI and COP further suggests that positive BDI shocks result in cumulative reductions in COP in the long run, whereas positive COP shocks result in cumulative increases in BDI both in the short run and the long run that are consistent with a complete pass-through of COP into BDI. It is implied that unexpected BDI increases in the SVAR model mostly capture negative supply shocks in the global transportation of commodities, because an increase in BDI results in a reduction of the demand for crude oil, which is a cost factor in the transportation sector. This result is supported by the Joint Open Letter to United Nations agencies from the global maritime transport industry on March 19th, 2020, where the global maritime transport industry has requested certain exemptions for international seafarers as the national regulations disrupt the supply of transportation.

With respect to the existing literature, the results of this paper are line with studies such as by Ivanov (2020) who have shown in their multi-stage supply chain model with suppliers, producers/factories, distribution centers and customers that transportation/shipment is an essential part in the flow of materials and finished products. Accordingly, having a supply chain disruption due to the national regulations in the transportation sector can easily result in productivity reductions as discussed in studies such as by Ivanov et al. (2014), Garvey et al. (2015), Dolgui et al. (2018), Pavlov et al. (2019), Dolgui et al. (2020) or Li and Zobel (2020), and these supply chain disruptions can should be evaluated by policy makers with utmost attention. The results in this paper are also consistent with studies such as by Baldwin and Tomiura (2020) who have predicted that COVID-19 is both a supply and a demand shock. These predictions are reflected in this paper as negative demand shocks in the global economic activity and negative supply shocks in the global transportation of commodities.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the data set and methodology used. Section 3 depicts empirical results, while Section 4 concludes.

2. Data and estimation methodology
We would like to measure the effects of COVID-19 cases in China and ROW on the global economic activity by using COP and BDI. While COP can capture demand changes in the global economic activity as suggested in studies such as by Kilian (2009), BDI reflects changes in the global transportation of commodities as suggested in studies such as by Isserlis (1938), Tinbergen (1959), Stopford (2008), Klovland (2002), Kilian (2009), Fan and Xu (2011), Qiu et al. (2012) and Makridakis et al. (2020). Based on this motivation, we utilize the SVAR model of  using daily data, where Δbt represents the weekly percentage change in daily BDI, and Δot represents the weekly percentage change in daily COP.

Daily COP are measured by “Europe Brent Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)” downloaded from the web page of the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).1 Daily data on BDI are obtained from the web page of Trading Economics.2 Weekly percentage changes in daily COVID-19 cases in China and ROW, represented by  and , respectively, are included as an exogenous variable in this framework; the corresponding data have been obtained from the webpage of Our World in Data.3 The combination of all data sets results in a daily sample period between January 28th, 2020 and November 15th, 2021.4 In the estimation, all daily variables are represented as weekly percentage changes to control for any seasonality concern by construction. The corresponding series included in the estimation are given in Fig. 1, where weekly percentage changes in daily COVID-19 cases have been more volatile during the early COVID-19 period.
